# test-repo

This repository is used for tests.

Purpose
-------

This repository serves as a workspace for automated and manual tests, experiments, and temporary artifacts. It is not intended to contain production code and may be modified or reset during testing. Keep changes minimal and ephemeral unless explicitly intended to be permanent.

If you need to run tests or add sample code here, please include a short note describing the test and any cleanup steps.
